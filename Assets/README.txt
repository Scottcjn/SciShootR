Thank you for your purchase!
If you have any questions please send me a mesage in Codester :)
SHORT INSTRUCTIONS:

IMPORTANT FOLDERS:
* EnemyWaves: In here there are all the waves that I created (you can create more) and also another folder with the pathpoints (the trajectory of the waves). In the wave config scriptable objects you can customize them as you want.
* Prefabs: In this folder there are all the objects that I used to create the levels (bullets, enemies, game essentials, particles, and more). You can use them for your levels or modify them.
* Scenes: In here there are all the scenes I created (Main Menu, Game Scene and Game Over Scene). 
* Scripts: In here there are all the scripts that I used to make the game.
* Game Assets and UI Sprites folders: In here I downloaded 2 free assets packs that are free to use for your game :)

MAKE YOUR OWN ENEMY WAVES:
1. Right click in assets, then create and then click Enemy Wave Config (The waves I made are in the folder EnemyWaves).
2. Create Path prefab (Look in EnemyWaves folder/ Paths for examples. But they are basically the points where you want the enemy to follow).
3. Set everything int the Enemy Wave Config Scriptable Object (Enemies for the wave, the path prefab...)
4. When your Enemy Wave Config is set drag it in the Enemy Spawner Object that is in the GameScene.
5. You can create as many waves as you want and also make them loop if you check the looping box in the Enemy Spawner GameObject.

SOME EXAMPLES OF IMPORTANT CUSTOMIZABLE OBJECTS:
* Enemies: You can customize basic things in the enemies inspector like Health, Enemy Score, It's laser, particles, sfxs, and more!
* Bullets/Lasers: You can customize the damage to the player.

I Hope you like this project and that it ends up being useful for you :)
